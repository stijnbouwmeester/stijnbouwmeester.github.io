# Retro 80s Starter for stijnbouwmeester.nl

How to edit:
- Edit content: open `index.html` in the GitHub repo and change the text inside the HTML.
- Edit styles: open `styles.css` to change colors and layout. Main color variables are at the top of the file (`:root`).

Common edits beginners do:
- Change the main title: edit the `<h2 class="title">` text in `index.html`.
- Change the subtitle or project descriptions: edit the `<p>` blocks and the cards.
- Add a new project: copy one `<article class="card">...</article>` and change contents.

How to add images:
- Upload the image file to the repo (Add file → Upload files) and then reference it in HTML, e.g. `<img src="myphoto.jpg" alt="...">`.

If you want:
- I can add a contact form (Formspree) — no server needed.
- I can add a portfolio gallery or a resume download link.
- I can commit these files for you if you'd like — say "Please add these to my repo" and I will walk you through or create step-by-step pushes.

Have fun! Want me to:
- Add a neon logo area or animated glitch effect?
- Or commit the files to your repo for you (I can provide exact push commands)?
