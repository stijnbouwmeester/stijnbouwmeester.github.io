Retro 90s Conspiracy Starter — how to edit

Files included:
- index.html — main page (edit text directly)
- styles.css — all styling; change colors at the top (CSS :root)
- guestbook.html — local guestbook using browser storage

How to edit (easiest for beginners):
1. Open your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/stijnbouwmeester/stijnbouwmeester.github.io
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Use the filenames above (index.html, styles.css, guestbook.html) and paste the contents.
4. Commit directly to main.
5. Visit https://stijnbouwmeester.nl to see changes.

Optional upgrades I can help with:
- Replace the local guestbook with Formspree so messages are emailed to you.
- Add animated GIFs (I can show how to upload GIFs to the repo and reference them).
- Add a GeoCities-era visitor counter that actually increments on the server (requires a small server or third-party service).
- Add a mirrored, glitchy frame layout or a "links" page like old personal sites.

Want me to commit these files into your repo for you?
- Say "Please commit these" and I’ll give you the exact copy/paste steps for the GitHub web UI or the git commands for your laptop.
